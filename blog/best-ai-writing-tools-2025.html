      <h2>2. Jasper</h2>
      <p>Jasper (formerly Jarvis) is the enterprise pick. It's got content workflows, templates, team collaboration, brand voice training — but it'll cost you. Plans start at $49/month.</p>
      <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Use it if you have a content team or agency. Overkill for solo creators.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Writesonic</h2>

      <h2>4. Copy.ai</h2>
      <p>Fast, sleek, and loaded with templates. Copy.ai shines for quick-turn marketing copy and eCom assets.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Sudowrite</h2>
      <p>If you're a novelist, screenwriter, or creative, Sudowrite is built for your brain. Less SEO — more flow, mood, and idea expansion.</p>
      <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Not for marketers. But for storytelling? 🔥</p>
    </section>
